# Bank-of-Baroda-Hackathon-2022

Video Analytics :
Bank is using video cameras for the purpose of surveillance at many branches,
ATMs and digital lobbies. Getting video analytics of different parameters from the 
video recording will help the bank to resolve many operational issues at the branches.
The bank wants to explore video analytics for understand the customer sentiments,
understand the patterns /behaviors/actions in certain branches for proactive surveillance 
and provide better services to customers.

Objectives:
Constantly scanning multiple video footage for:
1.	Sentiments of customers
2.	Tampering with the cameras / sensitive or high priority area within premises.
3.	Count of People
4.	Any activity that needs attention
5.	Time taken for activity on premises
6.	Identification of known facilitators 
7.	Feedback mechanism for false positives / incorrect classification for enhancement in model.



Approach :
	We are going to build a model with the help of deep learning using deep artificial neural networks.
	We are using a data set which has different types of expressions data. 
	With the help of image processing we will train our model with all the different expressions of images.
	We will make it recognize no of people with the help of image processing and Open CV.
	We also want the model to recognize old age people who would require help in getting service .
	We also want our model to detect any suspicious activity .
	Libraries which are going to be used:            
	Open CV
	NumPy
	Pandas
	Keras  .
	Matplotlib.
	With the help of Open CV we want to detect the emotions of the multiple people in the bank.
	We want to evaluate our model with all the requirements and improvise the model by increasing the data and making necessary requirements.
